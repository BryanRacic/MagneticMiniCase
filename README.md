## WARNING: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

## Overview
The complete structure is named: `complete_insert_v2` but has not yet been exported to an STL file

However, it's been pre-split for easy printing
  - For halves:
    - `lh_comp_insert2`
    - `rh_comp_insert2`
  - For quarters:
    - `blq_comp_insert2`
    - `brq_comp_insert2`
    - `tlq_comp_insert2`
    - `trq_comp_insert2`
 
The `steel_rail_2` file is glued to the ends of metal sheets to turn them into shelf inserts. You'll need at least 8 of these, but I recommend printing extra since they tend to break when attaching them to the metal sheets. I also recommend sanding & lubrication to make the shelves easier to pull in/out and much quieter.

## Materials list
- All of the 3d printed parts mentioned above 
- 11 3/4" x 4" Steel plates (to be used as shelves)
  - https://www.amazon.com/Rectangle-Straight-Connector-Thickness-Galvanized/dp/B09MFJBBD3 
  - You can optionally fit 2 plates on a single rail/shelf. This makes the shelves much more sturdy, but also significantly increases weight
- Super Glue for attaching the rail sections to the metal sheets 
  - I prefer [Gorilla Glue Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Super-Glue-Gram-Clear/dp/B00OAAUAX8)
- Medium grit sand paper, for better glue adhesion & FDM print finishing
- 2-Part epoxy adhesive, for attaching the 3d printed sections together
- Clamps/some heavy things for proper adhesion of the expoxy & printed parts
- (Optional) this was specifically designed as a replacement insert for the [Standard Battlefoam Sword Bag](https://us.battlefoam.com/bf-sword-bag-standard-load-out/) but will functionally work on it's own

## Extras
- The `Accessories` directory contains several printable inserts w/ premade holes for magnets (usually 10x1mm)
- The `Display` directory is a WiP, but will eventually become a wall shelf that holds steel inserts with a printable background to display minis outside of the case
